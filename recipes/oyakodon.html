    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Oyakodon, literally "parent-and-child donburi", is a donburi, or Japanese rice bowl dish, in which chicken, 
        egg, sliced scallion, and other ingredients are all simmered together in a kind of soup that is made with 
        soy sauce and stock, and then served on top of a large bowl of rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Base</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>10oz boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
            <li>3-4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Seasoning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 servings Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>4 sprigs mitsuba</li>
            <li>shichimi togarashi</li>
            <li>Japanese sansho pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepping the Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice 1/2 onion lengthwise, about 6mm wide.</li>
            <li>Chop 4 sprigs mitsuba ~1.3cm wide.</li>
            <li>Trim extra bits of fat and connective tissue from the chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>Cut chicken thighs along the grain ~2-2.5cm wide.  Then slice strips <em>against</em> the grain into 
            ~2cm sqaures.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to bowl or tray and sprinkle with 1 tbsp sake.  Set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into bowl, and lightly "cut" yolks but do not whisk together.  We want the mix of yellow and white
               for a marble pattern.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add sliced onions to frying pan and add seasoning mixture, simmer on medium heat</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add chicken on top of onions.</li>
            <li>Once simmering again with the chicken added, lower to medium low heat and cook uncovered for ~5 minutes
                or until the chicken is no longer pink and onions are tender.</li>
            <li>Raise heat to medium, add two-third of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions.  Avoid
                the edges of the pan where eggs can easily overcook.</li>
            <li>When eggs are set but still slightly runny, add rest of eggs to center and around edges of pan.  Add the 
                mitsuba on top and cook until eggs are done to your liking.</li>
            <li>Serve on top of steamed rice, and congrats, you have oyakodon for dinner!</li>
