    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pad Thai is a Thai noodle stir fry with a sweet-savoury-sour sauce scattered with crushed peanuts. 
        It's made with thin, flat rice noodles, and almost always has bean sprouts, garlic chives, scrambled egg, 
        firm tofu and a protein – the most popular being chicken or prawns/shrimp.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Base</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz flat rice noodles</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crushed peanuts</li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
            <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 cup beansprouts</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cilantro</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>8oz uncooked shrimp or tofu</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 tbsp light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sriracha hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp peanut butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, until just tender.  Rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, 
                chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, 
                or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.</li>
            <li>Add a little more oil, then add the eggs into the pan, breaking them into small pieces with spatula as they cook.</li>
            <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts, and peanuts to the pan, toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Garnish with green onion, peanuts, cilantro, and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
            <li>Congrats, you now have authentic Pad Thai for dinner!</li>
        </ol>
